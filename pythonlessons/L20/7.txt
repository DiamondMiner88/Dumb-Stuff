Mr. Spy received an encoded message from his superiors.
He knows that it was encoded with the following cipher:
− The message was first split into two halves (if the number of letterswas odd, then the first “half” was made 1 letter longer)
− The final encoded message was made by alternating the letters fromboth halves.
For example:
the word "computers" will be first split into two “halves”: "compu" and "ters".
Then, the encoded message will be "ctoemrpsu".
Write a function with 1 parameter: an encoded message. It should decode and return the messagefor Mr. Spy.
Examples:
decode("ctoemrpsu") → "computers"
decode("phyotn") → "python"
Can your function decode the message below?
"mciosmspiloins haecd"
